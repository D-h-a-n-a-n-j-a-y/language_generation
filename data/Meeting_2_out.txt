Let’s move on. Any matters arising?  Yes, Madam Chairman. I would like to ask on the progression of the Gala Night and Award Ceremony which has been proposed in the previous meeting. Have all the arrangement been matter?  Yes, all preparation have almost 90% done. That 10% is on progress in preparation of the gift.  Madam Chairman, I heard that we are having some difficulties with our current sponsor for our company trip to Korea. Is there any solution that has been prepaid for this kind of matters.  Yes, it is true that we have slight problems with our previous sponsor, it has been settled by replacing them with our new sponsor from Bank Pembangunan Negara.  Mrs Chairman, I’ve managed on the door gift during Gala Night Ceremony. I’ve ordered Baju Batik for every staffs. It still on packing process. I will complete that before event occurs. Besides that, the budgets for the door gift are recruiting.  Anything else to add, Zuraidah?  No, Mrs Chairman.  Shall we close this discussion for now and continue to any other business?  Yes Mrs Chairperson, maintenance of the building is really in a poor rate. For example, the air-conditioner system in level 3 are having problem and the technician took for about one week to take action.  Yes, that is true, I’ve been witnessing the situation for a few timesand many people complained too. Plus, I’ve experienced being stuck in the lift once.  That’s surprise me because I’ve already paid the technician on 27th November to fix the air-conditioner.  Well, I suggest we should exchange him with the new technicians since this is the fifth times this had happened.  Yes, I cannot refuse but to agree with it because we already give him a warning letter more than 3 times.  Okay, I will look into this matter. Mas, at the moment, could you please write a letter to the Human Resources Department asking them to find a new technician.  Yes, I will mind the order.  Thank You.
